# 4th-Project-Quiz-Application
## What I did in this project
This is a quiz application that I coded from scratch. In this project, I combined my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was able to follow the acceptance criteria that I was given, and develop a quiz that uti;ized almost everything that I have been learning so far!

## How this project challenged me
This project challenged me by pushing the limits by testing all of the things that I have learned so far in Javascript. I was able to add a timer to the quiz. This timer deducts 15 seconds from the time every time an answer is wrong, and it gives you a score based on your remaining time at the end of the quiz.

## What I learned from completing this project
Coding projects from the beginning really helps me to understand the concepts behind everything that I'm doing. Since everything I have been learning in Java Script has been going by so quickly, it was exremely beneficial for me to get some good practice coding things myself.
